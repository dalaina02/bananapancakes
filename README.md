<h2> Making Moves </h2>
<p>
Listening to "The Leap" on This American Life, I'm working out how crazy of a move it would be for me to quit my job and just learn to code.  I've crunched numbers and could survive for a couple of months but would exhaust my resources if so.  I'm going to keep my job until I achieve an employable talent level.
